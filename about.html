            <p class="presentacion_contenido_texto">As a motivated and detail-oriented business student currently pursuing a Master’s in
                 Project Management, I bring strong organizational and analytical skills, combined with practical experience 
                 supporting projects through research, data management, and operational assistance.</p>
            <p class="presentacion_contenido_texto">I am a self-taught Back-End Developer with beginner-level experience in SQL, Tableau, Power BI, 
                and JavaScript. Additionally, I have over five years of professional experience in Peru’s procurement process, where I coordinated 
                data entry and document management, monitored timelines, collaborated with suppliers, and maintained accurate ERP records to support 
                operational decisions. This experience has honed my ability to manage complex workflows, ensure accuracy, and contribute effectively 
                to cross-functional teams. I am passionate about delivering high-quality work in fast-paced environments and helping companies and 
                designers turn great ideas into reality.</p>
